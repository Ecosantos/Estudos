Hi everybody!

I'm studying how some functions behave and how could be useful express theoretical plots
If you want to contribute show some more possibilityes please do your commmits

#Example 1
eq = function(x){x^-11}
plot(eq(-10:10), type='l')

#Example 2
curve(x^2, from=1, to=10, , xlab="x", ylab="y")
